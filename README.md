# Assignment Description (By ChatGPT)
## 🎯 Assignment: House Price Prediction with Machine Learning

- Project Title: "Predicting House Prices Using Machine Learning"
- Deadline: [You decide — typically ± 1 week if done at your own pace]
- Goal: Build a script that predicts house sale prices based on property features.

## ✅ Project Requirements

### 1. Dataset
Use this free dataset from Kaggle:
👉 [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
You’ll need a free Kaggle account to download it.

### 3. Technical Specifications
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Use scikit-learn for building your machine learning model
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas, seaborn, or matplotlib
- Train at least one regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or a more advanced model)
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split)
- Evaluate your model using at least:
    ✔ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    ✔ Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Include basic visualizations of your results (e.g., feature importance, error distribution)
- Your code must be well-structured and include clear comments
- Provide a requirements.txt file listing all dependencies

### 3. Deliverables
- A single Python script or Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- A README.md file explaining:
    ✔ What your script does
    ✔ How to run it
    ✔ Short summary of your approach
- Screenshots of the most important results or visualizations
## 💼 Evaluation Criteria

Here’s how I will grade your project:

Category|Weight|Description
---|---|---
Functionality & Correctness|40%|	Does the script run? Are predictions logical?
Code Quality & Structure	|20%|	Is your code clean, readable, well-commented?
Analysis & Visualizations	|20%|	Are your EDA and results clear and insightful?
Extra Effort (Bonus)	|20%|	Additional models, tuning, saving model, etc.

Final Grade: A score between 1 and 10, based on quality, not flashy presentation. Expect honest, constructive feedback.

| --------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| ✅ **Functionality & Correctness** | 40%        | ✔ Script works end-to-end, correct handling of missing data, valid model training & evaluation.             | **8/10**   |
| ✅ **Code Quality & Structure**    | 20%        | ✔ Functions modularized, clear docstrings, good variable names. <br> ⚠️ Small redundancy in transformation. | **7.5/10** |
| ✅ **Analysis & Visualizations**   | 20%        | ✔ EDA basic but present. <br> ⚠️ No visualizations of feature importance, error distributions, etc.         | **5/10**   |
| ✅ **Extra Effort (Bonus)**        | 20%        | ✔ You used GridSearchCV, saved your model with joblib, included feature selection based on importance.      | **7/10**   |
