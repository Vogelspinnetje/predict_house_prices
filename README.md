An assignment created by ChatGPT: Predicting House Prices Using Machine Learning

## Assignment Description
### ðŸŽ¯ Assignment: House Price Prediction with Machine Learning

- Project Title: "Predicting House Prices Using Machine Learning"
- Deadline: [You decide â€” typically Â± 1 week if done at your own pace]
- Goal: Build a script that predicts house sale prices based on property features.

### âœ… Project Requirements

1. Dataset
Use this free dataset from Kaggle:
ðŸ‘‰ [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
Youâ€™ll need a free Kaggle account to download it.

3. Technical Specifications
Python 3.10 or higher
Use scikit-learn for building your machine learning model
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas, seaborn, or matplotlib
Train at least one regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or a more advanced model)
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split)
Evaluate your model using at least:
âœ” Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
âœ” Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Include basic visualizations of your results (e.g., feature importance, error distribution)
Your code must be well-structured and include clear comments
Provide a requirements.txt file listing all dependencies
Bonus Points For:
âž• Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV)
âž• Comparing multiple models and showing performance differences
âž• Saving the trained model with joblib or pickle

4. Deliverables
A single Python script or Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
A README.md file explaining:
âœ” What your script does
âœ” How to run it
âœ” Short summary of your approach
Screenshots of the most important results or visualizations
### ðŸ’¼ Evaluation Criteria

Hereâ€™s how I will grade your project:

- Category	Weight	Description
- Functionality & Correctness	40%	Does the script run? Are predictions logical?
- Code Quality & Structure	20%	Is your code clean, readable, well-commented?
- Analysis & Visualizations	20%	Are your EDA and results clear and insightful?
- Extra Effort (Bonus)	20%	Additional models, tuning, saving model, etc.
- Final Grade: A score between 1 and 10, based on quality, not flashy presentation. Expect honest, constructive feedback.
